# 2800_202410_BBY32 - The Carbon Cap

COMP2800 Projects course.
The theme of the course/project was to create an app that would extend and possibly be used 30 years into the future.
Our idea for this was an app designed for detecting, consolidating, and displaying data about the user's energy consumption in their home, so that they can make informed decisions to cut down on the electricity spending and consequently, their carbon footprint.

The design is supposed to assume things that may happen in 30 years, such as, but not limited to: 
- Mass adoption of EVs
- Aging populations
- Advanced technology in houses (ie. appliances, lifts, etc.)

The current implementation does not consider how these assumptions would impact the use of our app. Things we could be adding to show consideration to the assumptions of the future could include:
- Additional devices or appliances reflective of what houses in the future may have (assistive lift technologies for the elderly)
- Changes in the efficiency of devices (perhaps new devices in the future are many times more efficient)
- Electricity generation in the future may be skewed to be more green than now, lowering emissions
