# 2800_202410_BBY32 - The Carbon Cap

COMP2800 Projects course.
The theme of the course/project was to create an app that would extend and possibly be used 30 years into the future.
Our idea for this was an app designed for detecting, consolidating, and displaying data about the user's energy consumption in their home, so that they can make informed decisions to cut down on the electricity spending and consequently, their carbon footprint.

The design takes assumptions for things that may happen in 30 years, such as, but not limited to: 
- Mass adoption of EVs
- Aging populations
- Advanced technology in houses (ie. appliances, lifts, etc.)
