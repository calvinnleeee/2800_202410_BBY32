# 2800_202410_BBY32 - The Carbon Cap

COMP2800 Projects course.
The overarching theme of our project course was to envision and create and application, with a lasting impact that would extended beyond the next 30 years, within a Utopian context. With the global challenge surrounding climate change, and the need for sustainability in mind, our aim was to develop an app capable of detecting, consolidating, and displaying essential data concerning users' household energy consumption, financial implications, and carbon footprint.

The design anticipates future scenarios, such as, but not limited to: 
- Wide spread of EV usage
- Aging socities
- Advanced household technologies (ie. appliances, lifts, etc.)

The current implementation does not consider how these assumptions would impact the use of our app. Things we could be adding to show consideration to the assumptions of the future could include:
- Additional devices or appliances reflective of what houses in the future may have (assistive lift technologies for the elderly)
- Changes in the efficiency of devices (perhaps new devices in the future are many times more efficient)
- Electricity generation in the future may be skewed to be more green than now, lowering emissions.
